'''
Palo Alto Networks IoT POC Traffic Generator

Use input MAC addresses to source DHCP interactions and obtain IP addresses.
DHCP traffic is logged by FW as an EAL and sent to CDL and the IoT application.
IP addresses are captured to create logical interfaces on the IoT client host.
Lastly paho MQTT sessions are generated between an MQTT client and broker
MQTT traffic is logged by FW and sent to CDL and the IoT application.

This software is provided without support, warranty, or guarantee.
Use at your own risk.
